1. difference between null and undefined in js?
    undefined:
    undefined: when a variable is declared but has not been assigned a value, it is automatically initialized with undefined.

    null:
    null: null variables are intentionally assigned the null value.

let, const is block scope
var is function scope

2. what is the use of typeof operator?
    typeof operator is used to determine the type of each variable.

3. what is type coercion in js?
    is the automatic conversion, is used during String and Number concatenation.
    42 + '42' = '4242'
    string + number
    number + boolean 
    42 + 1 // output 43

Operators & Conditions
---------------------

4.what is operator precedence?
    As per operator precedence, operators with higher precedence are evaluated first.
 BODMAS - Brackets-Order-Division-Multiplications-Additions-Subtraction

 let a = 6, b = 3, c = 2;
 let result = a + b * c + (a - b)
 output: 15


5. what is the difference between unary, binary, and ternary operators?
    Operators based on number of operands
    unary:
    let a = 5
    // Unary operator single operand
    let b = -a;
    output: -5;
    ++a;
    output: 6

    Binary:
    let x = 10
    let y = 3
    // Binary operator two operands
    let z = x + y;
    output: 13

    Ternary:
    Ternary operator - Three operands
    let result = condition ? 'Yes' : 'No'
    output: 'Yes'

6. what is short-circuit evaluation in js?
    AND
    let result = false && test()
    if any one of the condition is false the && operator will return false, but in this case first condition itself it's false. so it return false

    OR
    let result = true || someFunction();
    // Output: true
